# Data Cleaning For Mice Protein

This repository contains preprocessing code and datasets used for classification tasks based on the Mice Protein dataset.

## Files Included

### 1. `BinaryClass.py`
- Python script used to:
  - Rename the `Class` column to `target`.
  - Convert the original multi-class labels into a binary classification label.
- This script was used to prepare the dataset for the **second run**.

### 2. `DataNoClass.csv`
- Dataset used for the **first run**.
- The `Class` column was removed to avoid influencing the results.
- The `Behavior` column was used as the target variable.
- Although originally processed with Python, the changes were simple and can also be done in Excel, so the code was not saved.

### 3. `DataSecond.csv`
- Dataset used for the **second run**.
- Contains the binary class generated by `BinaryClass.py`.
